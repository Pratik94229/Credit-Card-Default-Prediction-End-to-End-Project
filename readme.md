# Credit Card Default Prediction End-to-End Project

This is an end-to-end project that focuses on predicting credit card default using machine learning techniques. The project includes data validation,data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify whether a credit card holder is likely to default on their payment. This can help financial institutions and credit card companies identify potential defaulters and take appropriate actions to mitigate risk.




## Dependencies

The project's dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
To run the project locally, please ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook 
- ipykernel
- streamlit

Once you have the dependencies, follow these steps to set up the project:

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pratik94229/Credit-Card-Default-Prediction---End-to-End-Project.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Explore the collab notebooks in the `EDA/` directory to understand the data and the steps involved in preprocessing and training the regression model.

4. Run the script to preprocess,tranform the dataset along with training the model:

```bash
   python main.py
  ```


5. Tune the model by changing parameters in tuner.py:

 

Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different models and techniques to improve the prediction accuracy.
